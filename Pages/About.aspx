I graduated in 2023 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Shri Ramdeobaba College of Engineering. Despite my background in mechanical engineering, my fascination with software development led me to pivot towards a career in technology, where I have immersed myself in the world of .NET development.

            Over the past year, I have honed my skills in C#, Windows App development, ADO, and ASP.NET. My journey into .NET Fullstack development has been both challenging and rewarding, allowing me to blend my analytical skills with my creativity to build robust and dynamic applications.

            One of my most significant projects is HunterGamers, an e-commerce website designed to cater to the needs of gaming enthusiasts. This platform specializes in selling PS5 games and accessories. Throughout this project, I applied a wide range of technologies, including ASP.NET, the .NET framework, and MS SQL for the backend database. I meticulously crafted multiple web pages, ensuring a seamless user experience, robust functionality, and a secure transaction environment.

            HunterGamers showcases my ability to handle end-to-end development processes, from designing intuitive user interfaces to implementing complex backend logic. This project not only highlights my technical proficiency but also my commitment to delivering high-quality software solutions.

            As I continue to grow in my career as a .NET Fullstack Developer, I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute to innovative projects. My goal is to leverage my skills to create impactful software that enhances user experiences and drives business success. I am excited about the future and the endless possibilities that the field of software development holds.

            Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey. I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects. HunterGamers is an innovative e-commerce platform that I developed as part of my journey into .NET Fullstack Development.

            <span style="color: #FF3300; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">ASP.NET Framework:</span><span style="color: #FFFFFF"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif"> The foundation of HunterGamers is built using the ASP.NET framework. This powerful framework enabled me to create a dynamic and scalable web application. ASP.NET provided the tools necessary to manage server-side logic, handle user inputs, and render the web pages efficiently.

            </span><span style="color: #FF3300; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">C#:
</span><span style="color: #FFFFFF"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">C# was the primary programming language used throughout the development process. With C#, I was able to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code to implement the business logic, handle data processing, and manage various functionalities of the website.

            <br style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif" />
            </span><span style="color: #FF3300; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">SQL Server (MS SQL):</span><span style="color: #FFFFFF"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">

            The backend of HunterGamers is powered by Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL). I designed and implemented a robust database schema to store and manage all the necessary data, including user information, product details, orders, and transactions. SQL queries and stored procedures were used extensively to interact with the database, ensuring data integrity and optimized performance.

            </span><span style="color: #FF3300; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">ADO.NET:</span><span style="color: #FFFFFF"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">

             ADO.NET was used for data access and manipulation. Through ADO.NET, I established connections to the SQL Server database, executed SQL commands, and retrieved or updated data as needed. This allowed for efficient data operations and seamless integration between the application and the database.</span><br style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif" />
            </span><span style="color: #FF3300; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Front-End Development:</span><span style="color: #FFFFFF"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">

             The front-end of HunterGamers was designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive interface. This ensured that users could easily navigate through the website, view product details, add items to their cart, and complete their purchases without any hassle.
